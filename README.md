## About

In the current automotive industry, personalization is highly significant as consumers want vehicles that reflect their individuality. Traditional design methods, while effective, have limitations in capturing the nuances of each customer's vision, potentially resulting in a gap between expectations and reality.

`Voksa` harnesses Generative AI to craft personalized car designs, tailored to individual preferences. This approach revolutionizes traditional design methods, ensuring each design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and aligned with Volkswagen's brand standards.
